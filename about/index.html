					<p><strong>Molybdenum</strong> is a chemical element with symbol <strong>Mo</strong> and atomic number 42. The name is from Neo-Latin <em>molybdaenum</em>, meaning lead, since its ores were confused with lead ores. Molybdenum minerals have been known throughout history, but the element was discovered (in the sense of differentiating it as a new entity from the mineral salts of other metals) in 1778 by Carl Willhelm Scheele. The metal was first isolated in 1781 by Peter Jacob Hjelm.</p>
					<p>Molybdenum does not occur naturally as a free metal on Earth; it is found only in various oxidation states in minerals. The free element, a silvery metal with a gray cast, has the sixth-highest melting point of any element. It readily forms hard, stable carbides in alloys, and for this reason most of world production of the element (about 80%) is used in steel alloys, including high-strength alloys and superalloys.</p>
